## Introduction

A [ULMFiT](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.06146) model is trained to generate fortune cookie messages. The dataset is scraped from "[Fortune Cookie Message Archive](http://www.fortunecookiemessage.com/archive.php)". This dataset is pretty small due to the limited the online sources for fortune cookie messages. However, with the power of transfer learning and UMLFit, the model is able to generate fortune cookie style messages after only a few epochs of training.
